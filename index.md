# *Modern Love* The Podcast 

## What is it? 
* *Modern Love* is a weekly 20-minute podcast which is an audio recording of the weekly essay column, of the same name, from the New York Times. In each episode an actor, actress, or celebrity reads one of the hundreds of archived Modern Love essays of their choosing.

## General Podcast Structure 
* Each episode starts with a brief introduction from the host of the podcast, Meghna Chakrabarti, in which she outlines the main theme of the episode, gives some slight background on the content of the episode, and introduces the designated reader of the week’s episode. 
* Following the introduction, an edited recording of the designated celebrity reading the week’s episode is played. Typically, the reading is accompanied by a series of background sound effects that help make the essay come to life. The introduction and reading of the essay usually takes about twelve minutes, and is followed by a two-minute commercial break. 
* After the commercial break a recorded interview between Meghna Chakrabarti and the author of the essay is played. Sometimes Dan Jones, the editor of the *Modern Love* column, participates in the conversation alongside Meghna, but sometimes, when Dan is not available, they play a recording of his reaction to the piece following the conversation between the author and Meghna.
* After the recording of Dan Jones reacting to the essay, Meghna Chakrabarti plays a short recording of the next week’s *Modern Love* podcast and then closes by saying, “thanks for listening.”

# *Modern Love* Episode 5: "The Plunge"

## Introduction
* The host of the podcast, Meghna Chakrabarti, introduces herself and the podcast to the audience, provides a background and summary of the week’s episode, and let’s the reader know that Dakota Fanning is the guest reader for this week’s episode titled, “The Plunge.” Only Meghna is talking, as the introduction is prerecorded and edited into the podcast. 
* In this particular episode, Meghna lets the audience know that the major theme of this particular episode deals with a teenager recounting the traumatic experience of the first time she fell in love. 
* The Introduction establishes the basis of the narrative which the essay will build upon. 

## The Essay: Summary 
* Following Meghna’s introduction, an edited recording of Dakota reading “The Plunge” is played. This particular episode recounts the author’s first romantic adventure with her prom date Wilder. However, it is far from an ordinary story of first love, as while hiking with Wilder before prom, the author recounts how she slipped and fell over a hundred feet down the side of a cliff. 
* The back half of the essay recounts the aftermath of her fall, her miraculous full recovery, and the incredible compassion and care that Wilder showed her while she rehabbed from her injuries. The heart of the essay revolves around the fears that we have of falling in love and ties that theme in with the author’s actual fall into the canyon. It is a powerful and beautifully written essay that is wonderfully read by Dakota Fanning. 

## The Essay: Structure 
* Each and every week, throughout this portion of the podcast, only the voice of the celebrity reader is heard. This portion of the podcast is structured very similarly to an audiobook in that only the recorded voice of Dakota Fanning is heard. 
* Sound effects are added in, but Dakota is basically just dramatically re-reading Natalie Lindeman’s essay. The essay itself is very narrative in nature and the extremely structured.

## The Post-script
* After a two-minute ad break, the podcast continues with Meghna Chakrabarti discussing the essay with the author of the essay, Natalie Lindeman, and the editor of the *Modern Love column, Dan Jones. The conversation goes into greater detail about the events leading up to the Natalie’s essay, what Natalie was trying to capture in writing the essay, and what has happened since her essay was published. 
* This portion of the podcast is very conversational and seems like a lighthearted interview between Dan Jones, Meghna, and Natalie. There is clearly some structure in the questions being asked of the author, as they typically reflect the events being described in the essay, but this section of the essay remains very conversational and not all that structured. In this instance Natalie goes into greater detail about her fall, what she was trying to capture with her essay, and what happened between her and Wilder after the essay was published. 

## Sound Effects 
* The recording is filled with sound effects that add to the emotion in Dakota’s voice. When the essay is humorous, the sound effects are humorous, when the essay takes on a more serious bent, the sound effects become more serious. The use of sound effects is powerful, and makes the episode easy to listen to. 
* When Dakota reads the scene in which the author describes her fall off the side of the cliff, the sound of a growing alarm plays in the background; while when she reads of the author’s recovery at home a low yet dramatic playing of the piano can be heard in the background. The sounds effects give the podcast it’s heart.

## Closing Remarks
* Following the conversation Meghna plays a short recording of next week’s *Modern Love* podcast and then bids the audience goodbye accompanied by the *Modern Love* theme song.  

# *Modern Love* Episode 22: "The Doorman"

## Introduction 
* “The Doorman” begins with the host of the podcast, Meghna Chakrabarti introducing the *Modern Love* podcast, the major theme of the podcast, and the celebrity reader for this week’s episode. As always, the introduction is very structured and consists of the host, Meghna reading off of a script the details of the week’s episode.  
* In this particular episode the major theme is family, more specifically the family that we choose to adopt as our own. The celebrity reader is the SNL actress Cecily Strong, and the podcast details her relationship with her apartment doorman in New York City. 

## The Essay: Summary 
* “The Doorman” is an essay that captures the author’s close bond with her elderly Doorman, Guzim. The essay begins with Julie Hogben, the author, explaining to her date how she has to be home by a certain time so as not to worry her doorman. The essay then delves into Julie’s relationship with a womanizer which led to an unwanted pregnancy, and the fatherly role that Guzim played for Julie throughout the trying time. 
* Julie also details the role that doormen play in the lives of single women across all of the NYC and gives some background on Guzim’s traumatic childhood which has shaped him into the man he is today. 
* The back half of the essay deals with Guzim helping to raise Julie’s newborn child, Isabel, in any way that he can. In particular, she explains how Guzim took on a fatherly role in the eyes of Isabel. 

## The Essay: Structure 
* The essay is very narrative in nature, not at all that dissimilar from an audiobook, and it is pre-recorded. However, what makes this particular episode of Modern Love unique is that Cecily Strong is constantly changing the inflection of her voice throughout in order to reflect more masculine vocal qualities when reading parts of the essay in which Guzim is quoted. So, while the essay remains very narratively focused, it is powerfully read, which gives it an almost movie-like quality. 

## The Post-Script
* After a short two-minute break, the author of the work, Julie Hogben reads a postscript; however, rather than engaging in a conversation alongside Meghna, the host, and Dan Jones, the editor, Julie simply reads a post-script aloud to the audience. The postscript sounds conversational in tone, but is clearly interview based, as it sounds like Julie is answering a set of questions which the podcast provided to her. However, we the audience have not been made aware of the specific questions which Julie is replying to, so we just hear her detailing what has happened in her life since the publication of the essay and what she was originally trying to convey in writing the essay. 

## Sound Effects 
* Just as with “The Plunge,” sound effects play a crucial role throughout “The Doorman,” giving the podcast episode.
* At the start of the essay, a playful light jazz song plays in the opening of the episode highlighting the comical flirtation between Julie and her date due to the fact that Julie has to be home at a certain time so as not to worry her doorman. The light jazz beat makes the flirtation sequence even more awkward and funny.
* During the scene when Julie is describing walking home from CVS to pick up a pregnancy test, the bustling of cars can be heard in the background, and when she holds up the paper bag to show Guzim you can even hear the rustling of paper. 
* These are just a couple instances of added sound effects that add another layer of emotion to the episode. 

# *Modern Love* Episode 26: "One Last Swirl" 

## Introduction
* The host, Meghna Chakrabarti goes through her usual introduction in which she introduces some background knowledge about the week’s episode, discusses the major theme of the week’s episode, and introduces the reader of the podcast. However, since this particular episode is a re-airing of an earlier episode, she tells the audience as much. 
* In this particular episode, the major theme deals with death and mortality and the designated reader is Jason Alexander from Seinfeld. 

## The Essay: Summary 
* “One Last Swirl” details a man’s relationship to mortality. The essay begins with the author, Amory Siverston, trying to will his daughter’s dying goldfish back to life. The goldfish is about to perish, and Amory is trying to understand why the life of the goldfish matters so much to him. Then Amory begins to draw connections between the death of his parents with the impending death of his daughter’s goldfish. Amory then goes on to detail how his battle with cancer compares to the goldfishes lack of an appetite. 
* “One Last Swirl” is beautiful because it is able to capture our own mortality through a unique lens. 

## The Essay: Structure 
* Similar to the last two episodes, the reading of the essay is very narrative based, and consists of Jason Alexander performing a dramatic reading of Amory Siverston’s essay. This portion of the podcast is also very structured, as the reading of the essay is pre-recorded similar to an audiobook. 
* What makes this particular episode unique is Jason Alexander’s gift as a vocal performer. Jason is a master at dramatic pauses, and this is a characteristic that is more evident in this particular episode of *Modern Love*, than in any other episode. 

## The Post-script 
* The post-script for “One Last Swirl” is very similar to the conversational post-script interview of “The Plunge.” In both cases, Dan Jones and Meghna sit down alongside the author of the essay and discuss what inspired the writing of the essay and what has happened since the publication of the essay. 
* However, in this particular post-script, the author of the work is actually an employ of Dan Jones who writes for the New York Times. This gives the post-script an even greater conversational bent due to the familiarity between the interviewer and the interviewee. Also, in this particular post-script, Amory brings his daughter along for the interview, as she was one of the major characters in the story and she provided her own insight and her own opinion on her father’s essay. 
* All in all, this post-script was very liberally structured and consists of a very conversational interview between friends. 

## Sound Effects 
* As in all of the *Modern Love* podcasts, sound plays a major role in “One Last Swirl” and in this particular episode there are many instances in which sound effects enhance the emotion of the essay.  
* One example of the power of sound effects comes during the scene in which the author describes the feeding of the fish. You can hear fish food being dashed into the water, and you can hear bubbles as the fish swims towards the food. Similarly, when the author’s father is on his death bed, you can hear heavy and labored breathing, which captures both the emotional and physical pain associated with death. 

## Closing Remarks 
* As with every episode of *Modern Love*, Meghna closes the podcast by detailing the next week’s episode. However, this time, Meghna also makes more of a point to encourage other individuals to submit their own writings to the *Modern Love* column.
